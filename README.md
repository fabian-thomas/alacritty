## Motivation

I use symlinks quite a lot to quickly get to topics I'm working on.
Thereby, I usually symlink dirs to my home directory.
This has the additional advantage, that the working directory is pretty short.
When spawning a new terminal instance from Alacritty (SpawnNewInstance), the information about the symlink is lost because the kernel does not know about the symlink.
The information in the `procfs` that is used by default only contains the canonical working directory, not the one your shell shows you.
We can fix that by logging the working directory from our shell and then instructing alacritty to use that information.

### Setup

Alacritty by default exports the Xorg window id in the environment variable `WINDOW_ID`.
That makes it possible to log the current pwd for each alacritty window with help from your shell.
For alacritty this can be achieved with the following code in your `zshrc`:
```sh
# log pwd without symlinks stripped so that we can spawn new terminals
# with this information
mkdir -p "/tmp/pwds/$WINDOW_ID"
function chpwd {
    echo "$PWD" > "/tmp/pwds/$WINDOW_ID/pwd"
}
# store initial pwd
chpwd
function zshexit {
    rm -rf "/tmp/pwds/$WINDOW_ID"
}
```

On shell launch you can then further use the `PREV_WINDOW_ID` environment variable that this fork adds to change the shell directory:
``` sh
if [ -n "$PREV_WINDOW_ID" ] && [ -f "/tmp/pwds/$PREV_WINDOW_ID/pwd" ]; then
    cd "$(cat "/tmp/pwds/$PREV_WINDOW_ID/pwd")"
fi
```

This fork further adds `RAND_WINDOW_ID` and `PREV_RAND_WINDOW_ID` since Xorg window ids are reused when you kill and spawn a new window.

## Nix package

## About

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but
allows for extensive [configuration](#configuration). By integrating with other
applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to
provide a flexible set of [features](./docs/features.md) with high performance.
The supported platforms currently consist of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

The software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness; there are
a few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as
a daily driver.

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

## Installation

Alacritty can be installed by using various package managers on Linux, BSD,
macOS and Windows.

Prebuilt binaries for macOS and Windows can also be downloaded from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

For everyone else, the detailed instructions to install Alacritty can be found
[here](INSTALL.md).

### Requirements

- At least OpenGL ES 2.0
- [Windows] ConPTY support (Windows 10 version 1809 or higher)

## Configuration

You can find the documentation for Alacritty's configuration in `man 5
alacritty`, or by looking at [the website] if you do not have the manpages
installed.

[the website]: https://alacritty.org/config-alacritty.html

Alacritty doesn't create the config file for you, but it looks for one in the
following locations:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.toml`
3. `$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
4. `$HOME/.alacritty.toml`

On Windows, the config file will be looked for in:

* `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`

## FAQ

**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**

Benchmarking terminal emulators is complicated. Alacritty uses
[vtebench](https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench) to quantify terminal emulator
throughput and manages to consistently score better than the competition using
it. If you have found an example where this is not the case, please report a
bug.

Other aspects like latency or framerate and frame consistency are more difficult
to quantify. Some terminal emulators also intentionally slow down to save
resources, which might be preferred by some users.

If you have doubts about Alacritty's performance or usability, the best way to
quantify terminal emulators is always to test them with **your** specific
usecases.

**_Why isn't feature X implemented?_**

Alacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other
terminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it's just not a
good fit for Alacritty. This means you won't find things like tabs or splits
(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.
